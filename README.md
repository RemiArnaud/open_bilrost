# Bilrost
Bilrost is a rainbow bridge that reaches between Midgard (Human Earth) and Asgard (where Valhalla is).

I don't like to call local server to the Valhalla local server. I need to create a repo to split it out of fl4re-ui, while we find a suitable name I'm going to call it Bilrost.

The local server is a framework for several applications:
* Remote viewport
* RPC services
* Asset Management
* Content Browser (includes local storage)
* MarkUp to HTML (wiki)
* Proxy (doc, project management ..)
* other plugable modules

This repo is started as a fork of fl4re-ui to keep history.
